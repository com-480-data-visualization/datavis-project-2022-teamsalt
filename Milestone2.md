## Visualization layout of the website
The basic idea is that the visualization will have 3 parts. <br>
First after a short text introduction of the visualization, there will be a ranking of movies in the form of a list. One or two lists displayed 
at a time with the possibility to change some attributes and do some filtering. For instance, show top rated movies by rating or by number of votes. 
Filtering can take movies per genres, per year and maybe some famous actors for example. The movies on the list can be hovered for additional information. <br>

Then for the second part, there will be a plot. The value of the axis can be selected to dynamically update the plot. The idea is to observe different evolution
of the ratings, the number of votes, popularity of the genres, ...
<br>

Third part
